# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
This repository has been created as part of the ALX ProDev Frontend program.  
It focuses on documenting the *Requirement Analysis* phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate understanding of how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented.
- Provide a structured reference for both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Illustrate how to use tools like **Draw.io** for visual modeling (Use Case Diagrams).
- Define clear **Acceptance Criteria** for better project validation and delivery.

By completing this repository, we aim to build a strong foundation for the next development phases such as design, implementation, and testing.
