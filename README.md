# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

##  Introduction
This repository has been created as part of the ALX ProDev Frontend program.  
It focuses on documenting the *Requirement Analysis* phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate understanding of how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented.
- Provide a structured reference for both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Illustrate how to use tools like **Draw.io** for visual modeling (Use Case Diagrams).
- Define clear **Acceptance Criteria** for better project validation and delivery.

By completing this repository, we aim to build a strong foundation for the next development phases such as design, implementation, and testing.
##  What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented in detail before development begins.

The main goal of this process is to ensure that everyone involved in the project — from developers to clients — has a **clear and shared understanding** of what the system should do and how it should perform.

###  Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis
- **Understanding Needs:** It identifies *what users need* from the system and what problems the software must solve.  
- **Defining Scope:** It helps establish the *boundaries* of the project and prevents unnecessary features (scope creep).  
- **Laying the Foundation:** It serves as the *blueprint* for design, development, and testing.  
- **Ensuring Quality:** Clear and validated requirements help deliver a product that meets expectations and satisfies users.  

In short, *Requirement Analysis* bridges the gap between the client’s vision and the developer’s implementation — transforming ideas into actionable, testable, and measurable requirements.
