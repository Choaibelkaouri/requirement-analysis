# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

##  Introduction
This repository has been created as part of the ALX ProDev Frontend program.  
It focuses on documenting the *Requirement Analysis* phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate understanding of how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented.
- Provide a structured reference for both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- Illustrate how to use tools like **Draw.io** for visual modeling (Use Case Diagrams).
- Define clear **Acceptance Criteria** for better project validation and delivery.

By completing this repository, we aim to build a strong foundation for the next development phases such as design, implementation, and testing.
##  What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented in detail before development begins.

The main goal of this process is to ensure that everyone involved in the project — from developers to clients — has a **clear and shared understanding** of what the system should do and how it should perform.

###  Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis
- **Understanding Needs:** It identifies *what users need* from the system and what problems the software must solve.
- **Defining Scope:** It helps establish the *boundaries* of the project and prevents unnecessary features (scope creep).  
- **Laying the Foundation:** It serves as the *blueprint* for design, development, and testing.  
- **Ensuring Quality:** Clear and validated requirements help deliver a product that meets expectations and satisfies users.  
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for every other phase, from design to deployment.  
Without clear and validated requirements, projects risk delays, scope changes, and costly rework.

Here are the key reasons why Requirement Analysis is essential:

### 1. Clarity and Understanding
It helps all stakeholders, including developers, clients, and end-users, share a common understanding of what the software should accomplish.  
This minimizes confusion and aligns everyone’s expectations.

### 2. Scope Definition
By clearly defining what is and is not included in the project, Requirement Analysis helps prevent scope creep, which is the uncontrolled expansion of features or objectives during development.

### 3. Basis for Design and Development
Requirements act as the blueprint for system design and implementation.  
Accurate requirements ensure that developers build the right product in the right way.

### 4. Cost and Time Estimation
Well-defined requirements allow teams to estimate budgets, timelines, and resources more accurately, leading to efficient planning and delivery.

### 5. Quality Assurance
When requirements are clear and testable, quality teams can create precise test cases to verify that the system meets all expectations, resulting in a high-quality product.

In summary, Requirement Analysis ensures that every line of code serves a clear purpose, every feature adds value, and every stakeholder knows what success looks like.

In short, *Requirement Analysis* bridges the gap between the client’s vision and the developer’s implementation — transforming ideas into actionable, testable, and measurable requirements.
